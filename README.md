### Tier 1 Apartment
#### [LIV at Valley Ranch Apartments](https://www.apartments.com/liv-at-valley-ranch-irving-tx/zwylpmx/), located at the cross of George Bush and 635, Google rate 3.8.
* Pros: Nice apartment have everything you need, trash valet and covered parking. about 15 to 20 mins drive to Addision (I assume you work in that area according to Leighton)
* Cons: Only the 2 bedroom 1 bathroom floor plan is right below your budget. But 986 sqft should be enought for you and Cassie.
* Thoughts: If you guys are okay with sleep in the same room and use the other room like a study/game room, this one is good. Having an extra bathroom door is a plus based on my experience arguring with Leighton lol.
