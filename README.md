# Apartment Shopping for Hunter and Cassie #
#### The following apartments are located on the Northeast side of Dallas. Areas include Dallas, Irving, Las Colinas, Farmers Branch,  Carrollton, Addison, and Richardson. 

## Tier 1 Apartment (Only based on my preferences)
### [LIV at Valley Ranch Apartments](https://www.apartments.com/liv-at-valley-ranch-irving-tx/zwylpmx/), located at the cross of George Bush and 635, Google rate 3.8.
* Pros: Nice apartment have everything you need, trash valet, and covered parking. about 15 to 20 mins drive to Addison (I assume Hunter works in that area according to Leighton)
* Cons: Only the 2 bedrooms 1 bathroom floor plan is right below your budget. But 986 sqft should be enough for you two.
* Comment: If you are okay with sleep in the same room and use the other room like a study/game room, this one is good. Having an extra bathroom door is a plus based on my experience arguing with Leighton lol.

### [75 West](https://www.apartments.com/75-west-dallas-tx/40s20kj/), located at the cross of 75 and 635, Google rate 3.9
* Pros: Surrounded by a lots of (fast) food place with a Costco 5 mins away, 15 mins drive from Addison Circle easy to work. They are having a move in special right now with a total of $800 gift card if you move in within 2 weeks.
* Cons: Good location leads to a just below budget price.

### [Tonti Lakeside](https://www.apartments.com/tonti-lakeside-dallas-tx/dcfkq0l/), located on 75, Google rate 4.4
* Pros: A nice and safe community with food places and stores in a walk distanece, also really close to our apartment. Really high review score means a good management company and leasing office.
* Cons: 30 mins away from Addison Circle, right below budget.
* Comment: This used to be on my top list, but I really hate the 1 bedroom floorplan and that's why I gave up.
