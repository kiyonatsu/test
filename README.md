#### The following apartments are located on the Northeast side of Dallas. Areas include Dallas, Irving, Las Colinas, Farmers Branch,  Carrollton, Addison, and Richardson. 

## Tier 1 Apartment (Only based on my preferences)

### [LIV at Valley Ranch Apartments](https://www.apartments.com/liv-at-valley-ranch-irving-tx/zwylpmx/), located at the crossing of George Bush and 635, Google rating 3.8.
* Pros: Nice apartment have everything you need, trash valet, and covered parking. about 15 to 20 mins drive to Addison (I assume Hunter works in that area according to Leighton)
* Cons: Only the 2 bedrooms 1 bathroom floor plan is right below your budget. But 986 sqft should be enough for you two.
* Comment: If you are okay with sleep in the same room and use the other room like a study/game room, this one is good. Having an extra bathroom door is a plus based on my experience arguing with Leighton lol.

### [75 West](https://www.apartments.com/75-west-dallas-tx/40s20kj/), located at the crossing of 75 and 635, Google rating 3.9
* Pros: Surrounded by a lots of (fast) food place with a Costco 5 mins away, 15 mins drive from Addison Circle easy to work. They are having a move in special right now with a total of $800 gift card if you move in within 2 weeks.
* Cons: Good location leads to a just below budget price.

### [Tonti Lakeside](https://www.apartments.com/tonti-lakeside-dallas-tx/dcfkq0l/), located on 75, Google rating 4.4
* Pros: A nice and safe community with food places and store within a walk distance, also really close to our apartment. High review score means a good management company and leasing office.
* Cons: 30 mins away from Addison Circle, right below budget.
* Comment: This used to be on my top list, but I really hate their 1 bedroom floorplan and that's why I gave up.

### [The Village Dallas](https://www.thevillagedallas.com/index.html), close to SMU, 5 mins away from our apartment, Google rating 4.3
* This is actually a community that has about 10 different apartments. If you go to their website and click 'The Neighborhoods', you will see all the apartments they have. And price vary based on different 'Neighborhood'.
* Pros: Nice community, close to our apartment so we can hangout more. Have stores like Tom Thumb, Target, Walmart, etc. And lots of food place.
* Cons: it's not really cons, but the community use their own electriicity company, so you basically don't have a choice.
